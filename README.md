# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates an intermittent bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application using client-side navigation.  The issue involves unexpected behavior where page content sometimes fails to update correctly after navigation.  The bug is difficult to reliably reproduce, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

Navigating between pages generally works as expected. However, under certain conditions, the content of the new page does not reflect the expected content, displaying the content of the previous page. This behavior is inconsistent and does not occur every time.

## How to Reproduce (Inconsistently)

The exact conditions causing this issue are unclear.  Repeatedly navigating between the Home page and the About page may eventually trigger the bug.

## Potential Causes

Possible causes include:

* **Race conditions:** Asynchronous operations may be causing conflicts during page transitions.
* **Caching issues:** Client-side caching or browser behavior may be contributing to the problem.
* **State management problems:** If state is not properly managed, this could lead to inconsistencies.

## Solution (Workaround)

The provided solution employs a workaround rather than a definitive fix for this intermittent issue.  The approach is to incorporate a small delay after navigation to improve the chances of content updates. This does not directly address the root cause, but it helps alleviate the problematic behavior. It is highly recommended to thoroughly investigate and identify the underlying cause if the issue is crucial to your application.
